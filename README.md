Avenue is based on some codes over at [iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker](https://github.com/merlos/iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker).
This application was developed by the contributor of the project (me), initally as a personal use app,
eventually it is developed to being more complete, and that it can be expected to be improved on as time goes by.
